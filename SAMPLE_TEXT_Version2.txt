# Sample data & quick test instructions

This file contains a sample CSV (header + rows) you can copy into a file named `sample_reviews.csv`
or paste contents into a spreadsheet and export as CSV for testing the Streamlit app.

Sample CSV content:
review_content
"Good product, arrived on time, works as described."
"Terrible packaging. Cable stopped working after two days."
"Average experience — nothing special, not worth extra cost."
"Excellent! Very fast delivery and works perfectly."
"Not as described. Missing parts and poor quality."

How to test quickly:
1. Save the above CSV text to `sample_reviews.csv`.
2. Install dependencies: see README.md.
3. Run: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Click "Use sample data" or upload `sample_reviews.csv`.
5. Click "Analyze".

Notes:
- The first run may download NLTK resources; the app shows a spinner for that.
- If you see errors about NLTK downloads on servers with no internet access, download the resources beforehand or run locally.
